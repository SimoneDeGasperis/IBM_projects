## Capstone project week 3

In this project I have explored segmentation and clustering of the neighborhoods in the city of Toronto.
Data about Toronto's Borough and Neighborhood have been taken from wikipedia. Then features about Borough and Neighborhood have been retreived from foursquare. Finally, segmentation and clustering have been applied on these data.
The following notebook is divided in 3 parts:

1) Data are retreived from wikipedia and cleaned

2) Data are completed with information about latitude and longitude

3) Clustering and Segmentation of these data.
